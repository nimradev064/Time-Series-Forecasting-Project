# Time-Series-Forecasting
This project begins with data exploration and preprocessing, aimed at understanding the dataset, identifying trends, and handling challenges like missing values or data scaling. Essential preprocessing steps such as normalization and data cleaning are applied to ensure readiness for model development.

A baseline model is developed using machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, and its performance is evaluated using metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, or MAPE. The model serves as a starting point for further experimentation.

Next, two experiments are conducted to improve the baseline model, focusing on hyperparameter tuning, adding LSTM or attention layers, and feature engineering. These efforts aim to enhance the modelâ€™s predictive capabilities and overall performance.

To ensure training efficiency, a checkpoint mechanism is implemented, allowing model weights to be saved and training to resume from a specific point if necessary. A retraining strategy is also designed to handle new data and maintain accuracy, addressing potential performance degradation over time.

Finally, the project deliverables include a detailed Jupyter Notebook with data exploration, model development, experiments, and evaluation, alongside a report summarizing findings, experiment outcomes, and future steps for improvement.
